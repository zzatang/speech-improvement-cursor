# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This document details the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline implemented for the Speech Improvement application. The pipeline automates testing, code quality checks, and deployment processes to ensure consistent, high-quality code delivery.

## Workflow Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of two main workflows:

1. **CI Workflow**: Runs code quality checks on every commit
2. **Deployment Workflow**: Deploys the application to Vercel when CI passes

### CI Workflow

Located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, this workflow:

- Triggers on:
  - Every push to the `main` branch
  - Every pull request targeting the `main` branch
- Runs on GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` runner
- Executes the following steps:
  1. Checks out the code
  2. Sets up Node.js 20
  3. Installs dependencies
  4. Runs ESLint to check code style
  5. Runs TypeScript type checking
  6. Builds the application
  7. *(Future enhancement)* Runs tests when implemented

### Deployment Workflow

Located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, this workflow:

- Triggers when the CI workflow completes successfully on the `main` branch
- Runs on GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` runner
- Executes the following steps:
  1. Checks out the code
  2. Installs Vercel CLI
  3. Pulls environment information from Vercel
  4. Builds the project artifacts
  5. Deploys the built artifacts to Vercel

## Setup Requirements

To fully utilize this CI/CD pipeline, you need:

1. **GitHub Repository**: The application code must be hosted on GitHub
2. **Vercel Account**: For deployment
3. **Vercel Project**: Linked to your GitHub repository
4. **Vercel API Token**: For authenticating deployment operations
5. **GitHub Secret**: The Vercel API token must be stored as a GitHub repository secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN`

## Setting Up GitHub Secrets

For the deployment workflow to function, you need to set up the Vercel token as a GitHub secret:

1. Generate a Vercel API token from your [Vercel account settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
2. Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `VERCEL_TOKEN`
5. Value: Your Vercel API token
6. Click "Add secret"

## Local Testing

Before pushing changes, you can run the same checks locally that the CI workflow will perform:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Run TypeScript type checking
npm run typecheck

# Build the application
npm run build
```

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Viewing Workflow Runs

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Select the workflow you want to inspect from the left sidebar
4. Click on a specific workflow run to view details

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Failed Linting**: Run `npm run lint` locally to identify and fix issues
- **Type Errors**: Run `npm run typecheck` locally to find and fix type-related issues
- **Build Failures**: Check the build logs for specific errors that need addressing
- **Deployment Failures**: Verify your Vercel token is valid and has sufficient permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Pull Request Workflow**: Make changes in feature branches and create pull requests to main
2. **Code Reviews**: Utilize the CI workflow results during code reviews
3. **Fix Issues Promptly**: Address any issues flagged by the CI workflow before merging
4. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to maintain security and compatibility

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Testing**: Implement Jest or other testing frameworks and add test execution to the CI workflow
2. **Code Coverage Reports**: Add code coverage reporting to track test coverage
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Add performance testing to ensure the application maintains speed
4. **Security Scanning**: Implement automated security scanning for dependencies and code
5. **Branch-Specific Deployments**: Set up preview deployments for feature branches

## Conclusion

This CI/CD pipeline provides automated quality assurance and deployment for the Speech Improvement application. It ensures that only code that passes quality checks makes it to production, maintaining high standards of quality and user experience.
