# Integration Validation Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the validation test plan for Phase 4, Step 4 of the Speech Buddy implementation. The goal is to verify the complete end-to-end functionality of the application, confirming that all integrated components work together correctly to provide a seamless user experience.

## Test Environment

- **Browser**: Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Safari (latest)
- **Device**: Desktop and mobile (responsive testing)
- **Network**: Stable connection (also test with throttled connection to simulate real-world conditions)
- **Accounts**: Fresh test account for clean testing flow

## End-to-End Test Flow

### 1. Authentication Flow Validation

1. Navigate to the application root URL
2. Click "Get Started" or equivalent call-to-action
3. Complete the sign-up process using a test email
4. Verify successful redirection to the dashboard

**Expected Results**:
- Sign-up process completes without errors
- Authentication tokens are properly stored
- User is correctly redirected to the dashboard
- Dashboard displays personalized elements based on the new account

### 2. Navigation and Route Protection

1. From the dashboard, navigate to the "Repeat After Me" exercise
2. Attempt to access protected routes directly (via URL) when logged in
3. Log out and attempt to access protected routes directly
4. Clear cookies/storage and attempt to access protected routes

**Expected Results**:
- Navigation between dashboard and exercises works seamlessly
- Directly accessing protected routes works when authenticated
- Unauthenticated access to protected routes redirects to sign-in
- Authentication state persists correctly across page refreshes

### 3. TTS Functionality Validation

1. In the "Repeat After Me" exercise, select different focus sounds (R, S, L, Th)
2. Click the play button to trigger TTS audio generation
3. Test with different difficulty levels
4. Test the audio controls (pause, volume, etc.)

**Expected Results**:
- TTS API is called with correct parameters
- Australian-accented audio is generated and plays correctly
- Different focus sounds produce relevant practice phrases
- Audio controls function as expected

#### 3.1 TTS Google Cloud Authentication Fix Notes

During validation testing, a persistent authentication error ("The incoming JSON object does not contain a client_email field") occurred when attempting to generate TTS audio. This indicated a problem with how the Google Cloud client libraries were loading service account credentials within the Next.js server environment.

The issue was resolved by:
1.  Moving the Google Cloud service account JSON credentials from the `.env.local` file into a dedicated `google-credentials.json` file in the project root.
2.  Updating the `.env.local` file to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the *path* of this new JSON file (e.g., `./google-credentials.json`).
3.  Modifying the client initialization logic within the relevant library files (`lib/google/text-to-speech.ts` and `lib/google/speech-to-text.ts`). Instead of relying on the library's potentially problematic automatic credential discovery, the code now:
    *   Explicitly reads the credentials file using Node.js `fs` and `path` modules, resolving the path from `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
    *   Parses the JSON credentials.
    *   Passes the essential `client_email`, `private_key`, and `project_id` directly to the `TextToSpeechClient` and `SpeechClient` constructors.

This ensures correct authentication by bypassing potential conflicts between the Google Cloud libraries and the Next.js server-side environment's handling of environment variables and file paths.

#### 3.2 TTS Sound Type Switching Implementation Notes

During validation testing, an issue was identified where switching between different sound types (R, S, L, Th) failed to correctly generate new audio. The following fixes were implemented:

1. **Audio Element Reference Fix**: 
   - Updated to reference the state variable `practicePhrases` instead of the static `PRACTICE_PHRASES` array
   - Added thorough checking of the audio element's source in the play button handler
   - Fixed detection logic for loaded but paused audio

2. **Audio Resource Clearing**:
   - Implemented explicit clearing of audio sources when changing phrases
   - Modified `fetchPracticePhrase` to force audio element reset before fetching new audio
   - Added `useEffect` dependency tracking to detect phrase changes

3. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed logging to track audio element state
   - Implemented phrase focus change detection with console logging
   - Added validation for sound type mapping

4. **Volume Control Fixes**:
   - Added immediate volume application when toggling the mute button
   - Implemented a dedicated `useEffect` hook to monitor volume state changes and apply them to the audio
   - Updated `playAudioFromResponse` to respect volume settings instead of skipping playback when muted
   - Added console logging for volume state changes to assist with debugging

5. **Text-Audio Synchronization**:
   - Fixed an issue where the displayed text didn't match the audio being played
   - Implemented a two-step API flow:
     1. First request the generated phrase text from the practice API (`returnText: true` parameter)
     2. Update the UI display with this text before playing any audio
     3. Generate and play the TTS audio using exactly the returned text
   - Enhanced the speech API route to support the `returnText` parameter for different response formats
   - Modified the `TTSResponse` interface to include the `generatedText` field for tracking
   - Added a `processAudioResponse` helper function to handle audio blob processing consistently
   - Implemented proper content-type checking to handle both JSON and audio responses
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the process for debugging and traceability

These changes ensure that when navigating between different sound types, the application correctly:
- Resets the audio state
- Maps the proper sound type to the API parameter
- Generates new audio for the selected sound type
- Provides appropriate loading state feedback
- Correctly handles mute/unmute actions in real-time
- Displays the exact text that corresponds to the audio being played

### 4. ASR Functionality Validation

1. After playing TTS audio, click the record button
2. Speak the displayed phrase clearly into the microphone
3. Complete recording and wait for analysis
4. Review the feedback provided

**Expected Results**:
- Recording starts and stops correctly
- Audio is properly submitted to the ASR API
- Analysis results return within acceptable time (<5s)
- Feedback includes accuracy metrics and improvement suggestions
- Targeted sound analysis reflects the current exercise focus

#### 4.1 ASR Sound Analysis Enhancement Notes

During validation testing, an issue was identified where the ASR functionality was not accurately detecting mispronunciations for L sounds, consistently providing high accuracy ratings even for incorrect pronunciations. The following improvements were implemented:

1. **Enhanced L Sound Analysis**:
   - Added specialized detection logic specifically for L sound mispronunciations
   - Implemented pattern matching for common L sound substitutions (w, y)
   - Created additional heuristics to identify words that might contain both 'l' and its common substitution 'w'
   - Added a more conservative accuracy estimation for limited samples

2. **Detailed Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the analysis process
   - Included transcript content, detected words with target sounds, and classifications
   - Logged detailed information about how accuracy percentages are calculated

3. **Feedback Refinement**:
   - Added an intermediate feedback tier for moderately good pronunciations (70-90% accuracy)
   - Limited the number of suggested practice words to avoid overwhelming users
   - Ensured suggestions are more specific to the detected issues

4. **Accuracy Calculation Improvements**:
   - Implemented a custom accuracy calculation specifically for L sounds
   - Added safeguards to prevent overly optimistic ratings with small word samples
   - Created separate code paths for different sound types to allow for specialized analysis

5. **Phrase Comparison Analysis**:
   - Added a fundamental check to compare what the user actually said against the target phrase
   - Implemented a sophisticated phrase similarity algorithm that checks:
     - Word presence (how many words from the target phrase appear in the transcript)
     - Length differences (penalizing transcripts that are much longer or shorter)
     - Word order similarity (checking if matched words appear in the same order)
   - Provided immediate feedback when users speak completely different phrases
   - Weighted final accuracy scores to account for both sound pronunciation and phrase accuracy
   - Added specific suggestions to encourage correct phrase repetition
   - Integrated target phrase comparison in both frontend and API:
     - Modified `analyzeRecording` in page.tsx to send target text to ASR API
     - Updated ASR API route to extract and pass targetText to analysis function
     - Enhanced speech-to-text.ts with `calculatePhraseMatchScore` function (0-100% scale)
     - Implemented weighted scoring: 60% sound pronunciation, 40% phrase accuracy
     - Added debugging logs to track phrase matching throughout the process
     - Changed feedback logic to prioritize phrase repetition accuracy when score < 50%

These changes ensure more accurate and helpful feedback for all sound types, particularly for L sounds that were previously not receiving proper analysis. The feedback system now provides:
- More realistic accuracy scores based on actual pronunciation
- Better detection of subtle pronunciation issues
- More tailored suggestions for improvement
- Appropriate difficulty progression as skills improve
- Verification that users are actually repeating the displayed phrase

### 5. Complete Round-Trip Testing
