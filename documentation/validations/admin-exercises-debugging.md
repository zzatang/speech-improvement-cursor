# Debugging and Resolution: Admin Exercises Page Not Displaying Data

## Overview
This document details the investigation and resolution of an issue where the admin exercises page was not displaying any exercises, despite the Supabase table containing data and the network response being correct.

---

## Symptoms
- The admin exercises page (`/admin/exercises`) always displayed "No exercises found." even though the Supabase `speech_exercises` table had data.
- The browser network tab showed a successful (200 OK) response from Supabase with the correct exercise data.
- No errors were present in the browser console related to data fetching or rendering.

---

## Investigation Steps
1. **Checked Network Response:**
   - Verified that the request to Supabase returned an array of exercise objects as expected.
2. **Inspected React Query Data:**
   - Added a debug statement: `console.log('exercises from React Query:', exercises);` before rendering the table.
   - Observed that the value of `exercises` was `{ data: [...], error: null }` instead of a direct array.
3. **Reviewed Rendering Logic:**
   - The table rendering logic checked `Array.isArray(exercises)` and `exercises.length`, which failed because `exercises` was an object, not an array.
4. **Traced Data Flow:**
   - Located the `getAllExercises` function in `lib/supabase/services/exercise-service.ts`.
   - Noted that it returned `{ data, error: null }` instead of just `data`.

---

## Root Cause
- The `getAllExercises` function was returning an object (`{ data, error: null }`), but the frontend expected an array of exercises.
- This mismatch caused the table to always render as empty, since `Array.isArray(exercises)` was `false`.

---

## Solution
- **Updated `getAllExercises`:**
  - Changed the return value to `return data;` so that only the array is returned.
- **Removed Debug Logging:**
  - After confirming the fix, removed the debug `console.log` statement from the page component.

---

## Verification
- Reloaded the `/admin/exercises` page.
- Confirmed that all exercises from Supabase were now displayed correctly in the table.
- Verified that the UI and all actions (view, edit, delete) worked as expected.
