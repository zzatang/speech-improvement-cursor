# App Flow Document: Stuttering Speech Improvement Web App

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user lands on the webapp, they are greeted by a welcoming and friendly landing page showcasing cute animated characters and a bright, colorful design that immediately sets a positive tone. The welcome screen briefly explains the purpose of the app, which is to help children aged 8 to 13 improve their speech through engaging exercises and interactive games. Users, who may be either the targeted children or their guardians accompanying them, are guided into a simple and intuitive sign-up process. In this process, the onboarding experience explains the value of the app using playful animations, invites the user to select a favorite mascot or even create a simple avatar, and collects minimal but vital information such as a username, an email address, and a password. Existing users are provided with a clear sign-in screen that uses a straightforward layout with large, easy-to-read buttons for login, along with an option to recover lost passwords through a secure “Forgot Password” feature. The app supports modern authentication flows through services such as Clerk Auth, ensuring that signing out, password recovery, and even potential email verifications are seamless and secure.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon signing in, the user is immediately taken to their personalized main dashboard where the overall design reflects progress and excitement. The home page is designed as a colorful, animated control center that includes a visually engaging progress map indicating the journey through different levels of practice. The dashboard also provides a dedicated area for avatar customization where users can pick a mascot or tweak their avatar using options earned via in-app rewards. Large, clearly labeled buttons lead to the core functions such as starting a new speech exercise, accessing reading practice, or navigating to the games section. Navigation menus, headers, and sidebars are all designed to be simple so that every option is clearly visible and can be accessed with minimal clicks. This intuitive dashboard then serves as the hub from which users smoothly transition into various practice activities.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a child selects an exercise from the dashboard, they are directed to the Guided Speech Exercises page. In the Repeat After Me section, a cute animated character appears on screen and speaks a phrase using Google Cloud’s Neural Text-to-Speech with an Australian accent. Immediately following this, a clear prompt encourages the child to repeat the phrase. During this exercise, live visual feedback is provided in real time through animations such as a nodding character or thumbs up icons, and behind the scenes, the app uses deep learning-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to process the child’s voice. If a child wishes to take on a reading challenge, they navigate to the Reading Practice page where illustrated passages are displayed sentence-by-sentence with highlighted words that guide pacing. A visual speech timer or pacing bar moves along with the text to help maintain the optimal speaking rhythm. After a speech exercise, users can record their speech using large, child-friendly buttons. The recording feature has an immediate playback option that allows the user to listen to their recorded voice, and fun voice filters like robot or echo effects are available to make practice engaging and playful. If attention shifts from formal exercises, users can start interactive games such as the Speech Quest Adventure or matching games where spoken words help overcome in-game challenges. Each game is integrated within the app so that moving from one feature to another feels seamless. Between these transitions, detailed pronunciation analysis is performed using phonetic analysis that breaks down speech into phoneme-level details. The app then provides clear, color-coded feedback on any speaking errors, along with gentle, natural language recommendations for improvement.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can access account settings from a clearly marked icon on the dashboard. In this section, children or their guardians can update personal information, change passwords, review progress data, and fine-tune notification preferences for friendly reminders and daily missions. The settings area also offers options to adjust privacy settings and manage consent notices, ensuring compliance with relevant child data and privacy regulations. Although there isn’t a billing or subscription module in this flow, any changes to user profiles or data preferences are automatically synchronized with the secure cloud-based database, Supabase, and the user is then seamlessly redirected back to the main dashboard to continue exploration or practice without interruption.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Should the user enter invalid information during login or sign-up, error messages appear in a simple, clear, and friendly manner. For example, if the password does not match requirements or if crucial information is missing, brief explanations are provided with suggestions for corrections. In the event of connectivity issues during audio processing or data sync, fallback pages ensure that children remain on a safe view that instructs them to check their connection while maintaining encouraging messaging. If a user attempts to access a restricted action without proper authentication, the app warns them politely and guides them to sign in properly. The design of error states is kept calm and reassuring to prevent any stress or confusion, particularly considering the young target audience.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the very first moment a new user lands on the app, the journey is crafted to be simple, engaging, and visually motivating. Starting with an inviting onboarding process featuring friendly characters and interactive design elements, users are effortlessly guided through sign-up and account creation. Upon entering the main dashboard, users are presented with a journey map of their progress along with options to select speech exercises, reading practice, and interactive games. With each exercise, whether it is repeating phrases, reading along with animated stories, or playing stimulating speech-related games, real-time feedback using advanced AI technologies keeps kids motivated. The smooth transitions between recording sessions, gameplay, and feedback analysis create a connected experience where every part of the user’s progress is carefully tracked and celebrated. Ultimately, the app ensures that every session ends on a positive note with a performance summary and clear recommendations, encouraging children to continue practicing in a secure environment that appreciates both their small victories and overall progress.
