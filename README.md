## VS Code and Cursor Setup

To optimize your development experience with this project, we recommend the following setup:

### VS Code Setup

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Install the recommended extensions when prompted, or go to the Extensions view and filter by "Recommended"
3. VS Code settings are already configured in the `.vscode/settings.json` file for:
   - Formatting on save with Prettier
   - ESLint integration
   - TypeScript workspace version
   - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
   - Improved import organization

### Cursor Setup

1. Install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - An IDE built on VS Code with AI features
2. Open the project in Cursor
3. The project includes custom Cursor rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory for:
   - Project-specific best practices
   - IDE configuration recommendations
   - Code style guidelines

4. Use Cursor's AI features by:
   - Pressing Ctrl+K to generate code
   - Pressing Ctrl+L to explain code
   - Using inline chat for context-aware coding assistance

The combination of VS Code and Cursor provides an optimal development environment for this project with code completion, AI assistance, and consistent code style enforcement.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### CI Workflow

The CI workflow automatically runs on every push to the main branch and on all pull requests:

- **Linting**: Ensures code follows the project's style guidelines
- **Type Checking**: Validates TypeScript types across the codebase
- **Building**: Verifies the application builds successfully

To view the CI workflow status, check the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository.

### Deployment Workflow

The deployment workflow automatically deploys the application to Vercel when changes are pushed to the main branch and the CI workflow passes:

1. The CI workflow runs first to ensure code quality
2. If CI passes, the deployment workflow:
   - Pulls environment information from Vercel
   - Builds the project for production
   - Deploys the built artifacts to Vercel

To deploy manually, you can still use the Vercel CLI or dashboard.

### Setting Up Vercel Deployment

1. Create a new project in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Link your GitHub repository
3. Configure the environment variables in the Vercel project settings
4. Generate a Vercel API token in your Vercel account settings
5. Add the token as a repository secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN` in GitHub:
   - Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your Vercel API token

```

## Documentation Setup

To implement the generated documentation from CodeGuide:

1. Create a `documentation` folder in the root directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir documentation
   ```

2. Place all generated markdown files from CodeGuide in this directory:
   ```bash
   # Example structure
   documentation/
   ├── project_requirements_document.md             
   ├── app_flow_document.md
   ├── frontend_guideline_document.md
   └── backend_structure_document.md
   ```

3. These documentation files will be automatically tracked by git and can be used as a reference for your project's features and implementation details.
